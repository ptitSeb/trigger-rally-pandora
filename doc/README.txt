Thanks for downloading Trigger! I hope you enjoy
the game. For updates, please visit:

  http://trigger-rally.sourceforge.net/


Before playing, building, or copying, please read
the license later in this file. If you don't agree
to it, you should delete this software.


Look at ~/.trigger/trigger.config in your favourite text editor
for configuration options.


///////////////////
// Configuration //
///////////////////


Defaults:

 key     action
Up      Accelerate
Down    Foot brake / Reverse
Left    Steer left
Right   Steer right
Space   Handbrake
C       Change camera view
M       Toggle map
< >     Rotate camera when in 3rd person cam
F12     Save a screenshot


Joystick support can be enabled in the
config file. I'd be interested in any
reports on the performance of the
joystick support.


Stereo support is available, for both quad buffer
hardware and anaglyph glasses. See README-stereo.txt
Kudos to Chuck Sites for this patch.

To build trigger open a terminal and, in the top level of
the trigger source directory, do:

./configure
jam

Thanks to Matze Braun for this excellent build system.

To run trigger without installing, copy the trigger
executable to the data sub-directory and run it from
there. That is:

cp ./trigger data
./data/trigger

If you are hacking on trigger and rebuilding often, you may
find it convenient to specify the --datadir option to
configure, then you will not need to copy the executable
after each build. The --datadir option expects a full path.

./configure --datadir=/home/$USER/projects/trigger-rally/data
jam
./trigger

Adjust the path to suit your system. Every time the options
to configure are changed run:

jam clean

before running 'jam' again. This ensures that trigger uses
the new configure settings.


//////////////////
// Installation //
//////////////////


If you wish to install trigger you'll need to specify the
--prefix and --datadir options to configure. The prefix
directory controls where trigger will be installed.

Here is a full example, adjust the paths to suit:

./configure --prefix=/home/$USER/local/trigger-rally \
            --datadir=/home/$USER/local/trigger-rally/data
jam
jam install
rsync -av --exclude='.svn' data/ /home/$USER/local/trigger-rally/data

Now you can run trigger, for example:

./local/trigger-rally/bin/trigger

will start trigger.


//////////////////////
// Content Creation //
//////////////////////

A. Car models
-------------
 
You can add completely new cars in the Wavefront .obj format with the
following restrictions:
 
  - Use only one material per .obj.
  - All faces must be triangles.
  - The material is ignored, only the texture defined by it gets loaded.
  - All meshes, besides the wheels, need to be on a single object.
  - Wheels are in their own files.
 
When exporting from Blender, following settings work:

  - "Apply Modifiers"
  - "Include Normals"
  - "Include Edges"
  - "Write Materials"
  - "Triangulate Faces"
  - "Objects as OBJ Objects"
 
To test the model, replace the file name in an existing .vehicle file inside

data/vehicles/VEHICLENAME/

 
B. Levels/maps/tracks
---------------------
 
Use any tool that saves .png or .jpg images, for example GIMP and Inkscape.

You will need to create a heightmap, color map and need to assign coordinates.
You can create optional foliage and hud-map image files.

View existing .level files in data/maps or data/plugins/ to learn.

Best use .png for heightmaps, as .jpg can cause artefacts, which will change
the level geometry.


/////////////////////
// Troubleshooting //
/////////////////////


If something goes wrong, the you should check
your settings in ~/.trigger/trigger.config. You can
delete that file to reset everything to default. (It
will be recreated next time you run Trigger.)

Failing that, please visit Sourceforge to ask for help
on the forums or file a bug on the tracker:
