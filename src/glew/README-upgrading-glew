GLEW built and linked statically with the game to make troubleshooting
easier (one known GLEW version for each release).

To upgrade this included version, copy the glew.c from the latest glew
source archive into this directory, and the headers into GL/

Then add to the top of glew.c:

#define GLEW_STATIC

Hopefully this will allow the new GLEW to build statically with the game.

Also, for this last release, my build setup was a bit dodgy and wouldn't
cross-compile .c files.  So I renamed it to .cpp, and wrapped in an
extern "C" { }.  If I was more patient I might try to find out why...
